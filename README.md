# racial-segregation
Some R code I used to estimate racial segregation, essentially Getis-Ord G*, for pblic health research. The orignial function is from the spdep package. I 
modified it a bit to match Kershaw et al. (2017; JAMA Intern Med). You have to be careful before you use ratios with Getis-Ord G*. 
See my comments in the code.
